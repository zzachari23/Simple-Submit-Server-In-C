# Simple-Submit-Server-In-C

## About The Project 

The overall purpose of the program is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in C programming and the ability to incoporate data structures and libraries in other languages such as procedural programming languages like C. The program will be simulating a small part of my univeristy's CS submit server. The program will run student commands that will be compiled to some code and then are converted into exectuables. While another part of the program will test the compiled student code. The program will have four functions and the descriptions of these functions will be commented right before where the function starts. The program will also implement a data structure called a doubly linked list. The data structure will be used to hold the commands read in by the program to be later on used by the functions in the program.
